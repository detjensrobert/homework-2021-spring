### 1. Why is the rotational period of Jupiter equal to the number of hours between each image as shown in the equation on page 1?

*Juno* is in geostationary orbit, so the subject matter of the picture (the Great Red Spot) only appears under *Juno*
once per Jupiter day.

### 2. Divide the circumference of the ellipse in kilometers by the number of total hours covered, to find the speed of the GRS at the distance of the X from the center of the GRS. (Show your work.)

$$
Speed_X = \frac{Circumference}{Hours_{total}} = \frac{88,000\ km}{104.5\ h} = 842.105\ km/h
$$

### 3. Your answer from Question 2 is the approximate rotation speed. What is the rotation period, in days, at this distance from the center of the GRS? (Hint: What is the period in hours for the X feature?)

$$
Period_X = \frac{Circum}{Speed_X} = \frac{88,000\ km}{842.105\ km/h} = 104.5\ h
$$

### 4. Quantitatively compare the maximum speed of Hurricane Maria to what you found for the GRS. Do so by taking a ratio to find out how many times faster the GRS was than Hurricane Maria. Show all logic and comment on the comparison.

$$
\frac{Speed_{GRS}}{Speed_{Maria}} = \frac{842.105\ km/h}{280\ km/h} = 3.008x\ faster
$$

For something that large, the winds only being 3 times faster than the comparatively tiny hurricane is surprising. I
would think that the GRS would be several orders of magnitude faster to go with its much larger size.

### 5. Although the earliest observations of the GRS may date to the mid-1600s, records show it has been continuously observed since 1830. Considering the GRS is still present on Jupiter, how long has it been continuously observed?

$$
2020 - 1830 = 190\ years
$$

### 6. There are many things that are different between Jupiter and Earth, but what is so different that the GRS has lasted so much longer than any hurricane on Earth? Start by making a preliminary list comparing the planets' compositions, filling in the details for each planet.

| Property   | Earth                                               | Jupiter                                                                                                                                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Atmosphere | Mostly nitrogen, with oxygen and other trace gases. | Predominately hydrogen, with some helium and trace amounts of other gases. Gases also turn to liquid due to pressure deep inside the atmosphere. |
| Surface    | Solid, close to outermost layer.                    | Buried deep within the internals of the planet at extreme pressure.                                                                              |
| Interior   | Solid iron inner core with molten outer core.       | At the center of the planet under extreme pressure. Probably made of rocky materials, but the exact composition is unknown.                      |

### 7. In your opinion, which of these properties explains the difference in the extended lifetime of the GRS compared with any hurricane on Earth? Give the reasoning for your choice.

The atmosphere. Hurricanes on Earth die out once they move over land instead of water. Jupiter's atmosphere is much
deeper compared to Earth's, so there is no land for the storm to break up on, only more atmosphere. The storms can also
stretch deep into the layers of the atmosphere instead of being confined to a thin layer on the surface of Earth.

### 8. Current measurements of the velocity of the GRS range between 430 â€“ 680 km/h. Quantitatively compare your results to the range of values from this reference and comment.

The estimate calculated earlier in the lab (842.105 km/h) is much larger than the actual range.

### 9. Review the uncertainties in the circumference c we used for the GRS and calculate the minimum and maximum speeds. With these new calculations, taking into consideration the uncertainties, does your comparison with the range of values from the professional reference change? How or why not? Show your work here.

Minimum: $\frac{80,000}{104.5\ h} = 765.550\ km/h$

Maximum: $\frac{96,000}{104.5\ h} = 918.660\ km/h$

This range is still much larger the professional reference. The minimum value does get closer to the reference, but is
still off by a large amount.

### 10. Regarding your comparison with the published measurements in Question 8, identify what you think are specific sources of uncertainties.

The uncertainties in this estimate may be due to the manner in which the circumference of the GRS was estimated, as the
method used makes several shortcuts instead of using the true ellipse circumference formula. Estimating an ellipse with
the two circles used appears to have overestimated the size of the ellipse.
